## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

1. The **frontend** makes API requests to the **CoinGecko API** to fetch real-time cryptocurrency data.
2. The fetched data is processed and displayed on the dashboard with features like price tracking, market analysis, and interactive charts.
3. Users can select specific timeframes (e.g., 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days) to customize their view of market trends.
4. Data visualizations are dynamically updated based on user inputs using **Chart.js**.
